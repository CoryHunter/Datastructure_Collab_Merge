# Datastructure Merging, Classification, Rebalancing Algorthirm Demonstration
## What does this do?
This Program is a GUI to demonstrate a merge method that helps merge three manipulated
data structure into a single master data structure. Then the master data structure can be
can be classified as a General Tree, Not a Tree, BST or AVL. Then if all the nodes are 
numeric then there is a rebalancing algorithm than can turned into a BST.

## How does this do it?
The Code itself is written in JavaScript using GOJS. It is then displayed using HTML and CSS.
The outline of the program was made in oNote which is an event modeling tool. Here is
the Event Model:

## TODO:
- Implement the OptSet translation function
- Implement the classification function as outlined in *Algorithm Design and Optimization*
- Implement the BST constructor found in *Algorithm Design and Optimization*
- Design and HTML
- Upload images into README.md
